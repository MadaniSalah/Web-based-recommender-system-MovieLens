# Web-based-recommender-system-MovieLens
The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset. The system leverages machine learning techniques, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, to predict personalized movie ratings for users. Performance is evaluated through Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), calculated on a hold-out test set to assess the accuracy of predictions.

The project is part of the Data Science Professional Program Capstone offered by Harvard University on the edX platform. It provides an opportunity to apply the data science skills acquired throughout the program to a real-world problem. The objective is to develop a reliable and efficient movie recommendation system that generates personalized suggestions based on historical user data.
